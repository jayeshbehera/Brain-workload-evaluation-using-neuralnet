# Brain workload evaluation using Neural Networks

**##description**
This project is to analyze the workload of the brain using neural networks. To determine whther the perso's brain is having high,low or balanced performance.The analysis is done using the EEG frequency dataset of 30 volunteers

**#How to Run the project?**
1. Download all the files and keep it in same folder
2. Run "Server.r" file. (R Studio must be installed in your computer)
3. A dialogue box will open.
- upload the alpha.csv file in training dataset 
- then upload alpha_features.csv in Testing correlation
- then upload beta_feature.csv, gamma_features.csv and theta_features.csv 
4. click on alpha checkbox (as we are using the EEG signals of alpha range
5. click on header checkbox 
6. In the "enter the value of EEG signals" section ,enter the value of any 14 parameters of a person from the dataset provided or you can search on the internet for a drunk persons EEG signals which should show "low workload" (as the person is drunk and not very active)
7. click submit button and see the results.
8. You can see the comparision of all three algorithms and can conclude whether the volunteer brain is very active , medium active or not active.
